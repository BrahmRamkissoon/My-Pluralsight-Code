[Course Info](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/jscript-fundamentals) | Author: [Liam McLennan](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/liam-mclennan)

## Course Description
This course introduces JavaScript by examining each aspect of the language in detail. Learn how to get the most from the language of the web. 

### Module 3 - Functions:
In this module we're going to look at functions. Functions are the core piece of JavaScript. As Douglas Crockford says in this book JavaScript: The Good Parts, "The best thing about JavaScript is its implementation of functions." But functions do behave differently to other languages, so there are some things that must be understood before they can be used effectively. The first thing we'll do is take a look at a function, have a look at what the function looks like and the parts that make up a JavaScript function. Then we'll take a look at the different approaches that can be used when declaring functions. JavaScript provides a number of similar, but slightly different syntaxes for function declaration. Functions wouldn't be much good if we couldn't call them, so we'll have a look at function invocation and how that works. We'll talk about function overloading and how that applies to JavaScript. We'll look at the Arguments Object, which is a variable that's a special variable that's available inside of every JavaScript function. We'll take a brief look at function recursion, functions calling themselves. And finally we'll end with a discussion of closure and how that's implemented by JavaScript functions.

#### Note
I have opted to construct a simple site to showcase examples from the module sections instead of using JSBin.
