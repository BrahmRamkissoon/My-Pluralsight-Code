### Module 7 - Testing JavaScript:
This module will look at the different reasons why you might want to test your JavaScript and the tools and strategies available to help you with that. The first topic we'll look at is testing. We'll talk about why it's important and what kind of testing you might want to do for your JavaScript applications. We'll talk about QUnit, which is a tool that's part of the jQuery project. It makes it really easy to write JavaScript unit tests. An important topic for web developers is how to write tests that test DOM interactions. So, we're talking about testing JavaScript that interacts with web pages. I'll briefly introduce Behavior Driven Development, something that's become very popular in the last few years, and it applies as much to JavaScript as to every other platform. Specifically, we'll look at how to do Behavior Driven Development tests with a framework called Jasmine. And finally we'll look at ways that we can integrate our JavaScript testing into an automated build process.
