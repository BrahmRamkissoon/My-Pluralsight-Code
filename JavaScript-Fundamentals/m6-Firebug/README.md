### Module 6 - Firebug:
This module will introduce Firebug. Firebug is a developer tool add-on for Firefox and an essential tool in every JavaScript developer's toolkit. Firstly I'll introduce Firebug. We'll open it up, have a look, and a very quick tour of what Firebug is and what it looks like. We'll look at Firebug's capability for inspecting the HTML in a page. We'll look at the console facilities provided by Firebug including console logging, reporting of errors, and executing arbitrary scripts. Firebug provides capabilities for inspecting CSS files that are currently loaded. You can also inspect Network traffic and the currently loaded JavaScripts. One of Firebug's killer features is its JavaScript debugging capability. It's definitely one of the better JavaScript debuggers going around. You can do all the normal things like setting breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, viewing callstacks, and watching variables. Firebug is an add-on for Firefox, and YSlow is an add-on for Firebug. It adds performance analysis features to Firebug.
