# Pluralsight: JavaScript Design Patterns
[Course Info](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/javascript-design-patterns) | Author: [Aaron Powell](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/aaron-powell)

## Course Description
JavaScript should be treated like any programming language when it comes to designing your code structure. Throughout this course we'll look at a number of different design patterns which are useful when writing JavaScript centric applications. The course starts with several common patterns, including function argument patterns, chaining, and observable properties. We continue with a look at patterns using timers, including asynchronous execution and recursive setTimeout. Finally we review module patterns, pub-sub patterns, and the promise pattern. 

### Introduction
Hi. Welcome to JavaScript Design Patterns. My name is Aaron Powell, and throughout this course we're going to be looking at some tips and techniques to make more maintainable JavaScript Web applications and non-Web applications. We're going to be looking at a number of different design patterns which can be useful in making you achieve these goals. First off, we've got to understand exactly why we want to have some design patterns. The primary reason is, like any other application that you're going to be viewing, using JavaScript requires you to have a certain level of discipline to make sure that you can maintain your applications through the long run of your project. Many of the patterns that we will be looking at you can find more information about on my blog or you can follow me on Twitter which I occasionally blog and tweet about technical information.

#### Note
The following demos per module were skipped due to ASP.NET usage:

* Module 2 - setTimeout
* Module 3 - Asynchronous Module Definitions with RequireJS
* Module 4 - Pub/Sub Design Pattern

Until I grasp the ASP.NET framework, will need to seek another resource.
