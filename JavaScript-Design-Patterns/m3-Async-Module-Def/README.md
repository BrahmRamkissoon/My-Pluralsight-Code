# Pluralsight: JavaScript Design Patterns
[Course Info](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/javascript-design-patterns) | Author: [Aaron Powell](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/aaron-powell)

## Course Description
Throughout this course we'll look at a number of different design patterns which are useful when writing JavaScript centric applications. The course starts with several common patterns, including function argument patterns, chaining, and observable properties. We continue with a look at patterns using timers, including asynchronous execution and recursive setTimeout. Finally we review module patterns, pub-sub patterns, and the promise pattern. 

### Module 3 - Asynchronous Module Definitions: 
In this module we're going to be looking at the asynchronous module definition pattern or AMDs. Unlike languages such as C sharp JavaScript has no way that you can explicitly state that you have a dependency on some kind of external reference. Major discussion points

* specify dependency on some kind of external reference
* prevent scope leakage 
* discussing JS operations in a browser as blocking processes.
* Node.js and external references
* CommonJS is an attempt to standardize a number of common JavaScript patterns and practices. 


#### Note
I will be executing the .js files through node.js command prompt.
