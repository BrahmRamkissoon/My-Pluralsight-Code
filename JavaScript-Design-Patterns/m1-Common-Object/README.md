## Course Description
Throughout this course we'll look at a number of different design patterns which are useful when writing JavaScript centric applications. The course starts with several common patterns, including function argument patterns, chaining, and observable properties. We continue with a look at patterns using timers, including asynchronous execution and recursive setTimeout. Finally we review module patterns, pub-sub patterns, and the promise pattern. 

### Module 1 - Common Object Patterns: 
We're going to be looking at some tips and techniques to make more maintainable JavaScript Web applications and non-Web applications. We will cover:

* different design patterns which can be useful in making you achieve these goals.
* some design patterns which provide discipline to maintain applications.

#### Note
I will be executing the .js files through node.js command prompt.
