# Pluralsight: Structuring JavaScript Code
[Course Info](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/structuring-javascript) | Author: [Dan Wahlin](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/dan-wahlin)

## Course Description
With the rise of HTML5 more and more JavaScript code is being included in applications to leverage canvas, geolocation, local storage, and other key APIs. This course walks through several patterns that can be used to structure code in a way thatâ€™s more re-useable, more maintainable, and less susceptible to naming collisions. Learn about patterns such as the Revealing Module and Revealing Prototype patterns and see how they can be used to convert function spaghetti code into structured code that encapsulates variables and functions.

### Module 5 - Revealing Prototype Pattern:
In this module, we're going to talk about the revealing prototype pattern, another one of my favorites because it combines two of the other patterns we've already talked about in this course and merges together the best parts, so you get a lot of extensibility features and some other benefits that we'll talk about. So, in this module, we're going to start off, as we have in the others, talking about what is the pattern, why would I want to use it, and what are the pros and cons of this pattern? From there, we'll go into what's the structure of the pattern look like, and I'll show you a simple example of getting started writing JavaScript code that uses this pattern. And then from there, we'll jump into some demos of showing the pattern in use. And I'll show a couple of different ways that can be used and even how it can be extended.
