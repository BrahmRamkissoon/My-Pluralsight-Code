# Pluralsight: Structuring JavaScript Code
[Course Info](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/structuring-javascript) | Author: [Dan Wahlin](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/dan-wahlin)

## Course Description
With the rise of HTML5 more and more JavaScript code is being included in applications to leverage canvas, geolocation, local storage, and other key APIs. This course walks through several patterns that can be used to structure code in a way thatâ€™s more re-useable, more maintainable, and less susceptible to naming collisions. Learn about patterns such as the Revealing Module and Revealing Prototype patterns and see how they can be used to convert function spaghetti code into structured code that encapsulates variables and functions.

### Module 2 - Prototype Pattern:
Several different patterns exist for structuring JavaScript code to make it reusable, maintainable, and help it avoid naming conflicts. The first one we're going to talk about here is the prototype pattern. Now prototyping is a feature in the JavaScript language, and this particular pattern is going to leverage prototyping functionality. So the agenda is as follows. We're going to start off by talking about what is the prototype pattern as far as pros and cons and why you might want to consider it in some situations and not in others. From there, we'll take a look at how to structure your JavaScript code and actually use this pattern and apply it. And you'll see there're two parts to this--a constructor and a prototype section.

Dan's code was adapted to my simple webpage for the advanced prototype example.
