# Pluralsight: Structuring JavaScript Code
[Course Info](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/structuring-javascript) | Author: [Dan Wahlin](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/dan-wahlin)

## Course Description
With the rise of HTML5 more and more JavaScript code is being included in applications to leverage canvas, geolocation, local storage, and other key APIs. This course walks through several patterns that can be used to structure code in a way thatâ€™s more re-useable, more maintainable, and less susceptible to naming collisions. Learn about patterns such as the Revealing Module and Revealing Prototype patterns and see how they can be used to convert function spaghetti code into structured code that encapsulates variables and functions.

### Introduction
Welcome to the Structuring JavaScript Code in HTML5 Applications course. My name is Dan Wahlin with Pluralsight. In this course, I'm going to walk you through the process of converting from more of a function-based JavaScript coding style to more encapsulated and modular-based JavaScript coding, something that's better for reuse and better for maintenance. Now as you go through this course, you can find additional information about this topic and several others on my blog, and I also tweet about various technical topics as well, so if you're on Twitter, feel free to follow me there too.
