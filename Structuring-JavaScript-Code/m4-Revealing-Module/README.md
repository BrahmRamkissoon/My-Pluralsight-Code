## Course Description
With the rise of HTML5 more and more JavaScript code is being included in applications to leverage canvas, geolocation, local storage, and other key APIs. This course walks through several patterns that can be used to structure code in a way thatâ€™s more re-useable, more maintainable, and less susceptible to naming collisions. Learn about patterns such as the Revealing Module and Revealing Prototype patterns and see how they can be used to convert function spaghetti code into structured code that encapsulates variables and functions.

### Module 4 - Revealing Module Pattern:
In this module, we're going to take a look at the revealing module pattern, one of my personal favorites, and one I've used a lot in different web applications out there. So to start off, we're going to jump into what is this pattern, how does it differ from the module pattern, and what are some of the pros and cons? And you'll find that it's actually very similar to the module pattern. In fact, it has all kind of the same pros and cons associated with it. We'll then go into the overall structure of this pattern.
