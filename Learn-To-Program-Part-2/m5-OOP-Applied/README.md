## Description
Learning To Program 2 will introduce you to the fun and friendly Python programming language. In this course we'll focus on using and creating abstractions by trying different Python data structures, like the list, set, dictionary, and tuple. We'll also spend time looking at the fundamental concepts of object oriented programming, and how to apply those concepts when building a program.

### Module 5 - Object Oriented Programming Applied:
In this module we'll take a look at applying some of the object oriented concepts we learned about in the last module. We'll apply those to our shopping cart program that we built before. We'll build some classes, use those classes to create some objects, and talk about the design of a program using object oriented techniques. We're also going to get a quick look at building a Python module, which allows us to use multiple source code files. That's going to be important if you want to build bigger and bigger applications with Python.
