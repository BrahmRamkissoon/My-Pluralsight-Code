# Pluralsight: Learning To Program - Part 2: Abstractions
[Course Info](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/learning-programming-abstractions-python) | Author: [Scott Allen](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/scott-allen)

## Description
Learning To Program 2 will introduce you to the fun and friendly Python programming language. In this course we'll focus on using and creating abstractions by trying different Python data structures, like the list, set, dictionary, and tuple. We'll also spend time looking at the fundamental concepts of object oriented programming, and how to apply those concepts when building a program.

### Module 4 - Concepts of Object Oriented Programming:
In this module we're going to take a step back from writing code in Python, or at least we won't write as much code. Instead we're going to focus on some of the concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Objected oriented programming is a style of programming supported by many of today's mainstream languages. Including Python, but also C Sharp, C ++, Java, there's many others. In this module I want to give you some of the concepts around Object Oriented Programming or OOP as we call it. And we'll cover a few of the basics in this module and apply those concepts in the next module.
