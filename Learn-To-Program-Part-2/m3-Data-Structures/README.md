[Course Info](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/learning-programming-abstractions-python) | Author: [Scott Allen](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/scott-allen)

## Description
Learning To Program 2 will introduce you to the fun and friendly Python programming language. In this course we'll focus on using and creating abstractions by trying different Python data structures, like the list, set, dictionary, and tuple. We'll also spend time looking at the fundamental concepts of object oriented programming, and how to apply those concepts when building a program.

### Module 3 - Data Structures:
In this module we'll build a shopping cart. We'll let the user type in the items they want to buy and we'll maintain a data structure that keeps track of all the items the user wants to purchase. Along the way we're going to learn about some of the data structures we can use in Python, including lists which we've looked at before but we'll see some new capabilities. And we'll also see tuples, sets and dictionaries.
