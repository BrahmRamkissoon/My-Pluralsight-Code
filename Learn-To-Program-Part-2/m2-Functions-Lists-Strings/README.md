# Pluralsight: Learning To Program - Part 2: Abstractions

## Description
Learning To Program 2 will introduce you to the fun and friendly Python programming language. In this course we'll focus on using and creating abstractions by trying different Python data structures, like the list, set, dictionary, and tuple. We'll also spend time looking at the fundamental concepts of object oriented programming, and how to apply those concepts when building a program.

### Module 2 - Functions, Lists, Strings:
In this module we're going to build another game in Python. This game will be a game where the user has to figure out a secret word that our program has selected, and they get to figure out the word by guessing letters. If they guess the right letter, more of the secret word is revealed, and they continue playing. If the user guesses a letter that is not in the secret word, they get a strike. If they have too many strikes, they lose. To write this program, we have to learn how to create functions in Python, as well as use strings and lists. Functions, strings, and lists, they're all abstractions that we can rely on to make our programs a little bit simpler.
