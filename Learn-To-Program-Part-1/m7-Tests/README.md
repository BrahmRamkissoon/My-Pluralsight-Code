## Course Description
This first course in Learning To Program will get you started with the fundamentals of programming, like looping and working with source code files.

### Module 7 - Tests: 
This module is a look at testing JavaScript code. When we write code for a program, we need to see if the code is working properly. We all know that bugs and software are everywhere. It can be a challenge to write a program that works 100% correctly the first time. The process of checking your program to see if it works and produces the right numbers and doesn't crash, it's called testing. There are all sorts of techniques that you can use to test your code. For simple programs, you can just run the program after you add some code or make changes to see if it produces the right results. In this module I want to introduce you to automated testing. Automated testing can run your program again and again and automatically make some checks to see if it's working correctly.
