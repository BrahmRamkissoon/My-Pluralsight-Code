## Course Description
This first course in Learning To Program will get you started with the fundamentals of programming, like looping and working with source code files.

### Module 5 - Branch and Loop: 
In this module we're going to look at controlling the flow of execution in a program. This is where we check to see if something is true or false, like is a test score high enough to warrant the best grade in the class, or is it the lowest? We'll also be looking at looping in a program, which is a technique you can use to repeatedly execute a piece of code. That's something you might need to do if you need to compute the sum of a series of numbers.
